Week 10-12 Final Project - The Iron Yard Cincinnati 

The assignment: Build out a full web app, must pull from API, have a user authentication, and build a back-end DB pushing and pulling data from said DB. 
Ball Now (title still in the works). A web app, that allows you to view nearby basketball courts on a map and get a status update of each court. Users can post these updates to let other palyers know... how many people are on the court currently? If more people are expected to come? What the court condition is like? and any other updates deemed necessary. Users may also create groups to orginize their fellow ballers for quick and easy invite/message, whether that is just one friend or an entire group at once. Ball Now is an all inclusive app that creates a connection point for local basketball players to easily organize pick-up basketball games and to stay connected. 

Tech Used: HTML5/CSS3, SaSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MongoDB/MLabs, Angular, Node, Photoshop, and Lightroom. 

To Run: Pull all files and run "npm start" in the Mongoose folder through your terminal. App will run in "localhost:8080".
